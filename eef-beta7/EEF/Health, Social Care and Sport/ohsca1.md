*Adults:*

The proportion of adults meeting the Chief Medical Officerâ€™s guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a week declines as the area deprivation level increases. Since 2012, adults who live in the least deprived areas have been significantly more likely to meet CMO guidelines than adults who live in the most deprived areas (72% and 56% respectively). 

Since 2012, for men, the age standardised prevalence of adherence to the MVPA guidelines declined from 77% in the least deprived areas to 63% in the most deprived areas in 2017. Among women, the age-standardised prevalence of adherence to the MVPA guidelines declined from 67% to 51%.

*Children:*

In 2016, children (aged 2-15) living in the least deprived areas were more likely to complete an average of at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a day compared to children living in the most deprived areas (79% and 70% respectively).
