*Overweight and Obesity:*  

Between 2008 to 2011, 34% of respondents with a limiting long-term condition in Scotland were obese, compared to 30% of those with a non-limiting condition, and 24% of those without a condition.  

Between 2008 to 2011, there was no difference in the prevalence of overweight (including obese) between those with a limiting and non-limiting condition (both 68%). This was, however, significantly higher than the prevalence of overweight including obese among those with no long-term condition (63%).

*Health Harms:* 

Between 2008 to 2011, there was a significant association between cardiovascular disease and disability (24% of individuals with a limiting long term condition had a cardiovascular condition, compared with 14% with a non-limiting condition and 9% with no condition).
