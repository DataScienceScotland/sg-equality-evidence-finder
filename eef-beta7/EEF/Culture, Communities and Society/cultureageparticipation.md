* The Scottish Household Survey figures shows overall cultural participation was broadly similar for all age groups in 2017; however, participation decreased with age when reading was excluded from the measure.  

* Sixty one per cent of adults aged 16 to 24 participated in a cultural activity when reading was excluded. This compared to 39 per cent of adults aged 75 and over.
 
* For most cultural activities, younger adults, particularly those aged 16-24 were more likely than older age groups to participate in cultural activities. 

* However, older people were more likely to read for pleasure (65 per cent of those aged 75 or over and 56 per cent of adults aged 16 to 24) and do craftwork such as knitting, woodwork and pottery (18 per cent compared with 11 per cent).
